# Bus-Tracker

The Bus Tracking exercise introduced us to API's and fetching data from the internet. We fetched a map from the internet (mapbox) and used a marker to track a bus route from the MIT campus to the Harvard campus. The marker shows every stop on the route between the campuses. The webpage features a button that upon clicking moves the marker automatically, in set intervals, along the route of the bus.

Future Improvements: I plan on revising this and making it so the marker resets itself and goes along the trip again. Maybe add a button to stop the marker moving at certain stops along the route.
